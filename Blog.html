            <h2>My journey as English Learner</h2>
            <p>"My English learning journey evolved through several stages. I started with physical courses, then moved on to self-study using apps like Duolingo. I also read books and watched videos with English subtitles, occasionally translating from Persian to English. I practiced speaking daily, often with ChatGPT, and made it a habit to speak out loud</p>

            <h2>My Challenges</h2>
            <p>I faced many challenges preparing for the KONKUR exam in Afghanistan. Due to Taliban restrictions, I couldn’t attend classes or take the exam regularly, which made studying difficult. Still, I scored 311 out of 360 and got into a top university. Later, when I couldn’t attend university, I focused on learning English and computer skills by myself. Although not having my school certificate made things harder, now I have my certificate and I am fully prepared to study, get a scholarship, and study abroad. These challenges made me stronger and more determined.</p>

Additionally, I enjoy coding and creating websites, which is both fun and rewarding for me. These activities keep me balanced and motivated.</p>
